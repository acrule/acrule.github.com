<h2>APT</h2>

<p class="prompt">How can location-based apps change the way we interact with the world?</p>

<br clear="all" />

<h3>Background</h3>

<p> <em>Dates:</em> January - April 2012<br /> <em>Advisor:</em> <a href="http://art.washington.edu/index.php?id=18&faculty=59">Prof. Axel Roesler</a> </p>

<p>Each year Microsoft asks students at leading design schools around the world to enter into its Design Expo competition. In 2012, Microsoft asked student teams to consider how to use the sea of information being produced by end users daily and leverage that information to create a useful or engaging experiences. I worked with four other University of Washington students to design APT, a location-based app discovery and management tool.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Market Research</strong> - The entire class of University of Washington students collaborated in researching and sharing the latest advances in digital interactions including personal data tracking devices, augmented reality, and novel interaction inputs.</li>
    <li><strong>Conceptual Modeling</strong> - Our team mapped out the stakeholders and technologies involved in app discovery and management.</li>
    <li><strong>Video Prototype</strong> - Our team produced a video prototype of APT's functionality. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Outcomes</h3>
<p>APT was selected from a field of six teams to represent the University of Washington at Microsoft's Design Expo in summer 2012. We are currently working to refine the video and accompanying presentation for the Expo.</p>
