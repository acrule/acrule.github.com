Hello. My name is Adam Rule and I am a PhD student in <a href="http://cogsci.ucsd.edu">Cognitve Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu">UC San Diego</a>. I study human-computer interaction, developing technologies for complex and fragmented work. I have particular interests in interruptions, information visualization, and clinical informatics.
</p>
<p>
In my past work, I've optimized hospital scheduling to reduce patient wait time, designed interactions with an assistive robot, and improved the usability of health information technology.
</p>
<p>
I'm currently studying how writers, programmers, and artists get back into the flow of working after taking a day or two off. If you are currently working on a long-term writing, programing, or artisitic project, use a Mac, and are part of the UC San Diego community, you can participate! Participants get $50 in gift cards.
