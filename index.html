Hello. My name is Adam Rule and I am a PhD student in <a href="http://cogsci.ucsd.edu">Cognitve Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu">University of California, San Diego</a>. I study human-computer interaction by developing technologies for complex and fragmented work. I have particular interests in reducing the impact of interruptions, exploring the potential of multi-modal interfaces, and supporting the use of information technology in developing countries, a field known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communication_technologies_for_development">ICTD</a>.
</p>
<p> 
My past work has spanned the design - engineering divide. I've optimized hospital scheduling to reduce patient wait time, designed respect into an assistive robot, and made health software more usable.
