<h2>Hospital Scheduling</h2>

<p class="prompt">How should a public hospital schedule its patient appointments?</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>For my Senior Design Project I worked with three other students to improve the patient scheduling policies of a public hospital in the Chicago area. We focused on studying scheduling procedures in the hospital's infusion clinic, though similar scheduling policies were in practice throughout the hospital's 26 clinics. The infusion clinic serves patients in need of IV therapy ranging from hydration to chemotherapy. Length of treatment varies significantly in the clinic from 5 minutes to over 6 hours. Adding to the complexity is the fact that patients may shorten or lengthen their treatment by requesting faster or slower IV drip rates. This variability lead the clinic to schedule patients to all arrive simultaneously, though the clinic does not have the capacity to serve all patients at once.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>Our student team visited Stroger Hospital several times to speak with various stakeholders including doctors, administrators, nurses, clerks, and patients. These initial meetings lead into the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Process Mapping - We began by mapping patient, information, and blood sample flow throughout the clinic. This model was validated by hospital staff. Of special interest were the precedents and procedures surround blood testing and medication formulation.</li>
    <li>Data Collection - We spent two days in-clinic observing process flow, bottlenecks, and recording the time required for each step in the patient treatment process. This data was combined with data harvested from the clinic's computer systems. We also spoke to nurses, clerks, and patients to uncover other intervening factors. Parking problems were identified as a potential deterrent to changing scheduling policies, and we followed up with hospital staff on the matter.</li>
    <li>Process Modeling - I created a discrete event simulation using our process map and collected data. This model was made visual so that patient, nurse, blood sample, and medication flow could be observed as the simulation ran. This saliency allowed for visual validation of the model.
    <li>Verification and Validation - Our model was verified and validated by careful code study as well as comparing simulated values of nurse overtime and clinic closing time with actual values of these measures.</li>
Literature Review - Our team conducted an extensive literature review of scheduling policies in medical settings to understand optimal scheduling procedures.</li>
    <li>Future State Modeling - I took insights from our literature review and coded over 100 future state scheduling policies based on various scheduling heuristics. The impact of these policies on nurse overtime and patient wait time were tabulated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>A large part of our work was understanding what scheduling changes would be accepted by the hospital staff and patient population. Though we were able to research "optimum" scheduling policies, these policies would not have been enforceable at the hospital and too significant a change to be adopted in the current hospital environment. Intervening issues such as finding parking mid-day, or being transported by family members intervened with optimal scheduling policies. Our task was then to look for intermediate solutions between the current and "optimum" state and provide a roadmap for Stroger to adopt progressively better scheduling heuristics.</p>

<p>Our final recommendations, written in an extensive report to the hospital, were to first adopt a four-block scheduling system where patients could be scheduled at four different times throughout the day depending on the estimated duration of their treatment. We then outlined second and third steps, increasing the number of patient scheduling blocks throughout the day, and modifying nurse scheduling. These changes to hospital policies were estimated to save the clinic up to $145,000 a year. Hospital staff are currently implementing our plan and running similar cost analyses in other hospital clinics.</p>
