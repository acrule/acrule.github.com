<h2>Mamalode</h2>

<p class="prompt">How can an iPad reader facilitate support among mothers?</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Tablets have the opportunity to revolutionize how magazines are distributed and read. I worked with General UI, a Seattle based developer, and three other Masters students at the University of Washington in designing an iPad magazine reader for Mamalode. Mamalode is a Missoula, MT based magazine for mothers seeking to provide networking and support for mothers. </p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Semi-Structured Interview - Five mothers were interviewed regarding their views on mothering, reading habits, and use of technology.</li>
    <li>Social Network Mapping - Five mothers were asked to map and explain their social networks.</li>
    <li>Ideation - Over 200 product ideas were spawned from our user research.</li>
    <li>Prototype - The best ideas from our ideation were prototyped in an HTML/CSS/jQuery prototype of an iPad magazine reader.</li>
    <li>Usability Testing - Three users tested the usability of our prototype using an iPad. Each user was given a series of tasks to complete, and modifications were made to the prototype based on the usability testing results.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mothers read opportunistically</li>
    <li>Mothers have tight-knit support networks and share information about mothering selectively</li>
    <li>Mothers want time for reflective reading, but often feel guilty for taking time away from their families to read</li>
    <li>Mothers want magazine content to be relevant to their interests, their children's ages</li>
    <li>Mothers like relevant advertisements</li>
    <li>The iPad's microphone, camera, and keyboard afford a richer interaction with magazine content, especially for a magazine like Mamalode which prints reader submissions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prototype</h3>

<p> Our prototype may be accessed at <a href="http://nkkl.github.com/Mamalode-Prototype/"> http://nkkl.github.com/Mamalode-Prototype/</a></p>

<p>General UI is currently using our user research and prototype to propose a second phase of application development to Mamalode.</p>
