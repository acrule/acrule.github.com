<h2>Mamalode</h2>

<p class="prompt">How can an iPad reader facilitate support among mothers?</p>

<br clear="all" />

<h3>Background</h3>

<p> <em>Dates:</em> September - December 2011<br /> <em>Advisors:</em> <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/jkientz/">Prof. Julie Kientz</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mikewattux">Mike Watt</a> </p>

<p>Tablets have the opportunity to revolutionize how magazines are distributed and read. I worked with <a href="http://generalui.com">General UI</a>, a Seattle based developer, and three other Masters students at the <a href="http://washington.edu">University of Washington</a> in designing an iPad magazine reader for <a href="http://www.mamalode.com">Mamalode</a>. Mamalode is a Missoula, Montana based magazine for mothers which seeks to provide networking and support for mothers. </p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Semi-Structured Interview</strong> - Five mothers were interviewed regarding their views on mothering, reading habits, and use of technology.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Network Mapping</strong> - Five mothers were asked to map and explain their social networks.</li>
    <li><strong>Personas</strong> - Three personas were developed representing the mothers we studied.</li>
    <li><strong>Ideation</strong> - Over 200 product ideas were spawned from our user research.</li>
    <li><strong>Prototype</strong> - The best ideas from our ideation were prototyped in an HTML/CSS/jQuery prototype of an iPad magazine reader.</li>
    <li><strong>Usability Testing</strong> - Three users tested the usability of our prototype using an iPad. Each user was given a series of tasks to complete, and modifications were made to the prototype based on the usability testing results.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Findings</h3>
<p>Our research produced the following findings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mothers read opportunistically.</li>
    <li>Mothers have tight-knit support networks and share information about mothering selectively.</li>
    <li>Mothers want time for reflective reading, but often feel guilty for taking time away from their families to read.</li>
    <li>Mothers want magazine content to be relevant to their interests and their children's ages.</li>
    <li>Mothers like relevant advertisements.</li>
    <li>The iPad's microphone, camera, and keyboard afford a richer interaction with magazine content, especially for a magazine like Mamalode which prints reader submissions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prototype</h3>

<p> Our prototype may be accessed at <a href="http://nkkl.github.com/Mamalode-Prototype/"> http://nkkl.github.com/Mamalode-Prototype/</a></p>

<p>General UI is currently using our user research and prototype to propose a second phase of application development to Mamalode.</p>
