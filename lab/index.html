			<p><b>Welcome, we are gald to have you on board!</b> Whether you are a PhD student who will be in lab for several years of an MS or BS student working with us for just a semester, I (Adam) want you to thrive during your time with us. I have put together this guide to help you get off to a good start in the lab.</p>

			<h2 style="color:black">Day 1</h2>
			<p>Here are some tasks to do on your first day in the lab to get you off to a good start:</p>
			<ol>
				
				<li><b>Read this document</b>. It should take ~15 minutes.

				<li><b>Set up your space</b>. If you are a PhD student who has just joined the Inforamtion School, you should have a dedicated desk in Morgridge Hall from which to work. The iSchool's PhD Program Director should have let you know which room your desk is in, but if you don't know ask me. For all other PhD, medical, masters' and bachelors students working with the lab, you will not have a dedicated space from which to work, but you can use the many public working spaces available in Morgridge Hall (the home of CDIS and the Information School) or around campus.

				<li><b>Take the <a href="https://research.wisc.edu/kb-article/?id=84518">required research training</a></b> and email me your completion certificates. For everyone this should include the <a href="https://research.wisc.edu/compliance-policy/human-research-protection-program/hrpp-training/citi-human-subjects-protections-hsp-training-instructions/">CITI Human Subjects Training</a> (to do research with human subjects) and <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/enroll/D9DRHR">UW's Conflict of Interest Training</a>. If you are working with Protected Health Information you will need to take <a href="https://compliance.wisc.edu/hipaa/training/">HIPPA Training</a> as well. If you are funded by an NSF or NIH grant you may need to take the respective funder's Responsible Conduct of Research training (<a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/enroll/4JLCC9">NSF</a>, <a href="https://research.wisc.edu/kb-article/?id=33279">NIH</a>). If you are unsure what training you should take, ask me.				

				<li>Put together an <b>Individualized Development Plan (IDP)</b> summarizing your current skills, areas where you want to improve, and long-term goals. While setting an intention, deliverable, and plan (see below) will help you stay on track in the short term, your IDP will help us make sure your time with us prepares you for whatever comes next. For MS and BS students, here are some <a href="../files/idp/crystal_kwok_idp.pdf">good</a> <a href="../files/idp/rachel_chen_idp.pdf">examples</a> of IDPs. For PhD students, I recommend the <a href="https://myidp.sciencecareers.org/?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1">ScienceCareers IDP</a>. The site focuses on the biomedical sciences, but still has some great skills analysis and value setting exercises.
					
				<li><b>Set an intention</b> at the beginning of your time with us, write it down, and share it with me. What will you accomplish in the next semester or year of doing research with us in the lab? Make a <b>conservative goal</b> that you are reasonably certain you can accomplish, and a <b>stretch goal</b> that might happen if things go really well. For example, your conservative goal is to interview 12 nurses about their experiences with using AI to draft responses to patient messages, and your stretch goal is to have transcribed and done indicutive analysis of those interviews. Having a clear intention will enable you to focus your efforts, work effectivey, and know when you're done.

				<li>Also decide what your <b>final deliverable</b> will be (e.g., coded transcripts, a Jupyter Notebook documeting an analysis of data, a conference publication) and work backwards from there to put together a <b>schedule</b> of what you will accomplish this semester or year. Your plans will likely bounce around a bunch for the first two weeks but you should have a pretty clear goal by the middle of your second or third week. <b>Update</b> your conservative and stretch goals and schedule every few weeks as you better understand your research project.

				<li><b>Ask me to add you to the relevant IRB protocol</b> for your project. For the protection of human subjects, UW's Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews and approves our research that involves people before we conduct it. We just need to add your name to our IRB approved study protocol so you can work with us. If your research project is new, we may need to write the IRB protocol and get it approved first.
					
			</ol>
					

 			<h2 style="color:black">Meetings</h2>
			<p>If you are a PhD, medical, or masters student working with me on a research project, you should expect to meet with me 1-on-1 once a week to discuss the project. If we have not done so already, email me to schedule a weekly time to meet.</p>

			<p><b>Send me an agenda</b> for the meeting at least one hour in advance of the meeting so we can keep track of what we want to discuss. I find that shared documents such as notes in Notion work best so that both of us can edit the agenda. If there is something you would like me to read or provide feedback on (e.g., a paper draft, a qualitative coding hierarchy) send me a copy at least 1 business day in advance of our meeting so I have time to review it before we meet</p>

			<p><b>At the end of each meeting, update the agenda with clear next steps</b>, including what you will accomplish by our next meeting, and anything you need me to do before our next meeting.</p>

			<h2 style="color:black">Files and Code</h2>
			<p>Having clearly organized files will make it easier to keep track of your research, refind documents, and comply with regulations for the responsible conduct of research. Use campus approved storage facilities such as <a href="https://it.wisc.edu/services/google-workspace/">Google Drive</a> or <a href="https://it.wisc.edu/services/box/">Box</a> to store general research files such as non-sensitive data and draft manuscripts. Create a folder for your project in one of these platforms and make sure to share it with me so I can access the files as well.</p>
			
			<p>If you are working with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_health_information">Protected Health Information (PHI)</a> as defined by the HIPAA regulation, they will require more careful managment and can only be stored in PlatformX or a Secure Folder on Box (this is a special folder we need to request from Campus IT). If you are unsure if you are working with PHI, ask me. Most likely if you are working with PHI the data will already be in a Secure Folder on Box or on PlatformX as the Clinical Research Data Services team who queries and delivers PHI for research on campus will only deliver it to one of these platforms.</p>

			<p><b>Practice good data hygiene.</b> Operate by the minimum data necessary principle. Keep only the minimum data you need to conduct your research. Make sure it is deidentified to the maximum extent possible, even if it is not technically PHI. Make sure to log-out of or put your computer to sleep every time you leave the room. If you are using a laptop, make sure your computer is encrypted. Follow UW's policies to update your passwords regularly. If you are unsure if or how you need to clean your data, just ask.</p>

			<h2 style="color:black">The Collaborative Computing Lab</h2>
			<p>Our research group is part of the larger <a href="https://collab.ischool.wisc.edu/">Collaborative Computing Group</a> and the <a href="https://ischool.wisc.edu/">Information School</a>. Being a member of our group also means you are a part of these groups. You'll get a feel for the group, Collab, and iSchool cultures over time, but here are some things you should know and do up front:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We have regular Collab meetings throughout the semester. If you have not yet been invited, ask me to add you to the meeting invite.
				<li>The Collab has a shared Slack channel. Again, if you have not been added yet, ask me to add you.
			</ol>

			<h2 style="color:black">Reading</h2>
			<p>Great ideas rarely come out of the blue, so make time to regularly read relevant (and irrelevant) literature. If you want to do research in the future, learn the art of reading research papers. Expect to <b>read about 25 papers to get up to speed on a topic</b> (e.g. predicting no-shows, measuring note similarity, ambient scribes). If the paper is really good, email a link to the paper, video, or both to me and the rest of the group.</p>

			<h2 style="color:black">Writing</h2>
			<p>Clear writing leads to clear thinking. <b>Make a habit of writing about your work</b>, both what you have accomplished and what you plan to do. Start writing your papers well in advance of the deadline, and write each section as soon as reasonably possible. For example, you should write your methods section as you are running the study. Also consider writing the Abstract for your paper before you even start your research. If you cannot find a compelling story to tell before you have even collected data or run the study, think about how you could reframe or redesign your research so it is more likely to produce a compelling insight. For more on writing well, I recommend reading <a href='https://osf.io/n8pc3/'>The Writing Workshop</a> by Barbara Sarnecka.</p>

			<h2 style="color:black">Research Advice</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>When defining and evaluating your research, use the <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ddahlstr/misc/heilmeier.html">Heilmeier Catechism</a>
				<li>If you are considering going to grad school for a PhD, or already in a PhD program, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-What-You-Came-For/dp/0374524777">Getting What you Came For</a>.
				<li>Set boundaries on your work life so your personal and work life can thrive. You'll do much better work if you are well fed, well rested, and well loved so make time to eat right, exercise, sleep, and spend time with people who matter to you. For some great advice on doing deep work in grad school while limiting your time in the office see <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/">Cal Newport's blog</a>.
