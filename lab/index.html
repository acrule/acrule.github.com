			<p><b>Welcome, we are gald to have you on board!</b> We want you to thrive during your time with us, so we have put together a list of tactics to help you succeed.</p>

			<h2 style="color:black">Day 1</h2>
			<ol>
				
				<li><b>Read this document</b>. It should take ~10 minutes.

				<li><b>Take the <a href="https://research.wisc.edu/kb-article/?id=84518">required research training</a></b> and email me your completion certificate. For everyone this should include including the <a href="https://research.wisc.edu/compliance-policy/human-research-protection-program/hrpp-training/citi-human-subjects-protections-hsp-training-instructions/">CITI Human Subjects Training</a> and <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/enroll/D9DRHR">UW's Conflict of Interest Training</a>. If you are working with Protected Health Information you may need to take <a href="https://compliance.wisc.edu/hipaa/training/">HIPPA Training</a> and if you are funded by an NSF or NIH grant you may need to take the respective funder's Responsible Conduct of Research training (<a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/71645">NSF</a>, <a href="https://research.wisc.edu/kb-article/?id=33279">NIH</a>).

				<li><b>Ask to get added to our IRB</b>. For human subjects protection, UW's Institutional Review Board reviews and approves our research before we conduct it. We just need to add your name to our IRB approved study protocol so you can work with us.

<!-- 				<li><b>Get access to the lab</b>. If you are going to be coming in early or staying late it is a good idea to get key and card access to the lab. Ask Susan about getting a physicial key to the lab and how to get key-card access to Casey Eye Institute. -->

<!-- 				<li><b>Set up your space</b>. If you are working with us more than half-time, we will provide you with a permanent desk in the Informatics Lab (space permitting). Feel free to post your name by your desk, bring a coffee mug from home, post photos and papers by your desk, and so on. Posting recent work or papers you are reading helps others know what you are working on, and livens up the place. For those working with us less than half-time (or if we are running out of space), you can use any open desk in the lab, or head to the Ophthalmology Library down the hall which has hoteling desks and computers you can use. -->					

				<li><b>Set an intention</b> at the beginning of your time with us, write it down, and share it with me. What will you accomplish? Make a <b>conservative goal</b> that you are reasonably certain you can accomplish, and a <b>stretch goal</b> that might happen if things go really well. Having a clear intention will enable you to focus your efforts, work effectivey, and know when you're done.

				<li>Also decide what your <b>final deliverable</b> will be (e.g., working code, a conference publication) and work backwards from there to put together a <b>schedule</b> of what you will accomplish this quarter. Your plans will likely bounce around a bunch for the first two weeks but you should have a pretty clear goal by the middle of your second week. <b>Update</b> your conservative and stretch goals and schedule every few weeks.

				<li>Put together an <b>Individualized Development Plan (IDP)</b> summarizing your current skills, areas where you want to improve, and long-term goals. While your intention, deliverable, and plan will help you stay on track in the short term, your IDP will help us make sure your time with us prepares you for whatever comes next. Here are some <a href="../files/idp/crystal_kwok_idp.pdf">good</a> <a href="../files/idp/rachel_chen_idp.pdf">examples</a> of IDPs.
			</ol>

<!-- 			<h2 style="color:black">Meetings</h2>
			<p>Our group meets <b>every other Friday</b> at 9 or 10a in the conference room by the Informatics Lab (CEI 1106). Be on time. These group meetings are a great place to share in-progress work, get high-level feedback, and plan for the next two weeks. <b>Come prepared to talk for ~5 minutes</b> about what you have accomplished since the last meeting, what you plan to do these next two weeks, and any road-blocks you are encountering. If you want feedback on something that people will need to spend time reading or reviewing, don't expect them to read or review it during the meeting. Create a handout and email it to the group at least a day before the meeting.</p> -->

			<h2 style="color:black">Files and Code</h2>
			<p>We often work with human-subjects, health, or otherwise sesitive data. Sometimes this includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_health_information">Protected Health Information (PHI)</a> as defined by the HIPPA regulation. Be aware of your responsibilities to protect information, even if it is not PHI. For example, we may study providers' workflows and EHR use, information that should not be shared publicly.</p>

			<p><b>Practice good data hygiene.</b> Operate by the minimum data necessary principle. Keep only the minimum data you need to conduct your research. Make sure to log-out or put your computer to sleep every time you leave the room. If you are using a laptop, make sure your computer is encrypted. Follow UW's policies to update your passwords regularly. And de-identify your data, even if it does not include PHI. If you are unsure if or how you need to clean your data, just ask.</p>

			<p>Keep all your files on Google Drive. Put all of your files on the Lab's shared Drive folder. You can sync this folder to your computer desktop, but be selective about what you sync, both because some of the files we work with are large, and it is good to keep even fully de-identified data off our local machines. Ask us to give you access to the shared Box folder for your project.</p>

			<h2 style="color:black">The Collaborative Computing Lab</h2>
			<p>Our research group is part of the larger <a href="https://collab.ischool.wisc.edu/">Collaborative Computing Group</a> and the <a href="https://ischool.wisc.edu/">Information School</a>. Being a member of our group also means you are a part of these groups. You'll get a feel for the group, Collab, and iSchool cultures over time, but here are some things you should know and do up front:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The <b>whiteboard is fair game</b>. If you need to erase something to make space,  take a picture of it first.
				<li>There is a small kitchen down the hall with a mini-fridge and microwave. You can store and heat your food there.
			</ol>

			<h2 style="color:black">Reading</h2>
			<p>Great ideas rarely come out of the blue, so make time to regularly read relevant (and irrelevant) literature. If you want to do research in the future, learn the art of reading research papers. Expect to <b>read about 25 papers to get up to speed on a topic</b> (e.g. predicting no-shows, measuring note similarity). If the paper is really good, email a link to the paper, video, or both to the group. </p>

			<h2 style="color:black">Writing</h2>
			<p>Clear writing begets clear thinking. <b>Make a habit of writing about your work</b>, both what you have accomplished and what you plan to do. Start writing your papers well in advance of the deadline, and write each section as soon as reasonably possible. For example, you should write your methods section as you are running the study. Also consider writing the Abstract for your paper before you even start your research. If you cannot find a compelling story to tell before you have even collected data or run the study, think about how you could reframe or redesign your research so it is more likely to produce a compelling insight.</p>

			<h2 style="color:black">Research Advice</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>When defining and evaluating your research, use the <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ddahlstr/misc/heilmeier.html">Heilmeier Catechism</a>
				<li>If you are considering going to grad school for a PhD, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-What-You-Came-For/dp/0374524777">Getting What you Came For</a> and <a href="http://pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm">PhD Grind</a>. While it is more focused on Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Science research, in general <a href="http://pgbovine.net">Philip Guo's webiste</a> has great advice on grad school and academic careers.
				<li>Set boundaries on your work life so your personal and work life can thrive. You'll do much better work if you are well fed, well rested, and well loved so make time to eat right, exercise, sleep, and spend time with people who matter to you. For some great advice on doing deep work in grad school while limiting your time in the office see <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/">Cal Newport's blog</a>.
