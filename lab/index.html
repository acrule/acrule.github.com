            <p>Updated Mar 2019</p>

			<p><b>Welcome, we are gald to have you on board!</b> We want you to thrive during your time with us, so we have put together a list of tactics to help you do first-rate research from Day 1.</p>

			<h2 style="color:black">Day 1</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Set up your space</b>. If you are working with us more than half-time, we will provide you with a permanent desk in the Informatics Lab (space permitting). Feel free to post your name by your desk, bring a coffee mug from home, post photos and papers by your desk, and so on. Posting recent work or papers you are reading helps others know what you are working on, and livens up the place. For those working with us less than half-time (or if we are running out of space), you can use any open desk in the lab, or head to the Ophthalmology Library down the hall which has hoteling desks and computers you can use.

				<li><b>Read this document</b>. It should take ~15 minutes.

				<li><b>Take the required training</b> including OHSU's Responsible Conduct of Research and Information Privacy and Security Essentials <a href="https://ohsu.csod.com/samldefault.aspx">courses on Compass</a> and email me your completion certificates. If you will be working with human subjects (e.g., interviews and direct observation) then take the Human Subjects Research course as well. Also make sure to fill out your <a href="https://bigbrain.ohsu.edu/coi/">conflict of interest disclosure form</a> which OHSU requires of all researchers.
				<!-- You should also take the Human Subjects Research and Responsible Conduct of Research courses from the <a href="https://www.citiprogram.org/">CITI Program</a> and email me your completeion certificates. -->

				<li><b>Ask to get added to our IRB</b>. For human subjects protection, OHSU's Institutional Review Board reviews and approves our research before we conduct it. We just need to add your name to our IRB approved study protocol so you can work with us.

				<li><b>Get access to the lab</b>. If you are going to be coming in early or staying late it is a good idea to get key and card access to the lab. Ask Susan about getting a physicial key to the lab and how to get key-card access to Casey Eye Institute.

				<li><b>Set an intention</b> at the beginning of your time with us, write it down, and share it with me. What will you accomplish? Make a <b>conservative goal</b> that you are reasonably certain you can accomplish, and a <b>stretch goal</b> that might happen if things go really well. Having a clear intention will enable you to focus your efforts, work effectivey, and know when you're done.

				<li>Also decide what your <b>final deliverable</b> will be (e.g., working code, a conference publication) and work backwards from there to put together a <b>schedule</b> of what you will accomplish this quarter. Your plans will likely bounce around a bunch for the first two weeks but you should have a pretty clear goal by the middle of your second week. <b>Update</b> your conservative and stretch goals and schedule every few weeks.

				<li>Put together an <b>Individualized Development Plan (IDP)</b> summarizing your current skills, areas where you want to improve, and long-term goals. While your intention, deliverable, and plan will help you stay on track in the short term, your IDP will help us make sure your time with us prepares you for whatever comes next. Here are some <a href="../files/crystal_kwok_idp.pdf">good</a> <a href="../files/rachel_chen_idp.pdf">examples</a> of IDPs.
			</ol>

			<h2 style="color:black">Meetings</h2>
			<p>Our group meets <b>every other Friday</b> at 9 or 10a in the conference room by the Informatics Lab (CEI 1106). Be on time. These group meetings are a great place to share in-progress work, get high-level feedback, and plan for the next two weeks. <b>Come prepared to talk for ~5 minutes</b> about what you have accomplished since the last meeting, what you plan to do these next two weeks, and any road-blocks you are encountering. If you want feedback on something that people will need to spend time reading or reviewing, don't expect them to read or review it during the meeting. Create a handout and email it to the group at least a day before the meeting.</p>

			<h2 style="color:black">Files and Code</h2>
			<p>We often work with sesitive data and rarely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_health_information">Protected Health Information (PHI)</a>. Be aware of your responsibilities to protect information, even if it only pertains to providers and not patients. We often study providers' workflows and EHR use, information that should not be shared publicly.</p>

			<p><b>Practice good data hygiene.</b> Operate by the minimum data necessary principle. Keep only the minimum data you need to conduct your research. Make sure to log-out or put your computer to sleep every time you leave the room. If you are using a laptop, make sure your computer is encrypted. Follow OHSU's policies to update your passwords regularly. And de-identify your data, even if it does not include PHI. If you are unsure if or how you need to clean your data, just ask.</p>

			<p>Keep all your files on Box.com. Box is OHSU's secure and HIPPA compliant file hosting service. Put all of your files on the Lab's shared Box folder. You can sync this folder to your computer desktop, but be selective about what you sync, both because some of the files we work with are large, and it is good to keep even fully de-identified data off our local machines. Ask us to give you access to the shared Box folder for your project.</p>

			<h2 style="color:black">The Informatics Lab</h2>
			<p>Our research group is part of the larger <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/casey-eye/">Casey Eye Institute</a>and the <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/informatics">Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology</a>. Being a member of our lab also means you are a part of these groups. You'll get a feel for the Lab culture over time, but here are some things you should know and do up front:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>DMICE hosts a weekly Informatics seminar on Thursdays from 11.30a-12.30p. You should strongly consider going as it is where local as well as visiting students and faculty present their work. See the DMICE website for more info.
				<li>The <b>whiteboard is fair game</b>. If you need to erase something to make space,  take a picture of it first.
				<li>There is a small kitchen down the hall with a mini-fridge and microwave. You can store and heat your food there.
				<li> There is a cafeteria and eating area on the first floor for staff and patients.
			</ol>

			<h2 style="color:black">Reading</h2>
			<p>Great ideas rarely come out of the blue, so make time to regularly read relevant (and irrelevant) literature. If you want to do research in the future, learn the art of reading research papers. Expect to <b>read about 25 papers to get up to speed on a topic</b> (e.g. predicting no-shows, measuring note similarity). If the paper is really good, email a link to the paper, video, or both to the group. </p>

			<h2 style="color:black">Writing</h2>
			<p>Clear writing begets clear thinking. <b>Make a habit of writing about your work</b>, both what you have accomplished and what you plan to do. Start writing your papers well in advance of the deadline, and write each section as soon as reasonably possible. For example, you should write your methods section as you are running the study. Also consider writing the Abstract for your paper before you even start your research. If you cannot find a compelling story to tell before you have even collected data or run the study, think about how you could reframe or redesign your research so it is more likely to produce a compelling insight.</p>

			<h2 style="color:black">Research Advice</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>When defining and evaluating your research, use the <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ddahlstr/misc/heilmeier.html">Heilmeier Catechism</a>
				<li>If you are considering going to grad school for a PhD, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-What-You-Came-For/dp/0374524777">Getting What you Came For</a> and <a href="http://pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm">PhD Grind</a>. While it is more focused on Human-Computer Interaction and Computer Science research, in general <a href="http://pgbovine.net">Philip Guo's webiste</a> has great advice on grad school and academic careers.
				<li>Set boundaries on your work life so your personal and work life can thrive. You'll do much better work if you are well fed, well rested, and well loved so make time to eat right, exercise, sleep, and spend time with people who matter to you. For some great advice on doing deep work in grad school while limiting your time in the office see <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/">Cal Newport's blog</a>.

			<h2 style="color:black">Projects</h2>
			<p>Most of our research revoles around using EHR data to study clinical workflows. Broadly our research splits into two groups, those studying how EHRs are used, and those using EHR data to support improving clinic operations. Here are a couple example projects:
			<ul>
				<li>Predicting which patients will not show up for their next appointment
				<li>Predicting the length of office visits
				<li>Analyzing when and how many notes clinicians access during an office visit
				<li> Measuring the similarity between a patient's consecutive progress notes
			</ul>
