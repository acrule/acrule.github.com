			<h1>Working with Adam and Jim</h1>
			<p>Let me start by saying, <b>Welcome, we're gald to have you on
                board.</b> I want you to thrive during your time with us. To
                that end, I've put together a list of tactics to help you do
                first-rate research from Day 1.</p>

			<h2 class="mt-3">Day 1</h2>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Set up your space</b>. If you're working with us more
                    than half-time, we'll provide you with a dedicated desk in
                    the Design Lab. We can also provide a monitor, mouse, and
                    keyboard for your time in the group. For those working
                    fewer hours, the Design Lab has hoteling desks and monitors
                    you can use.
				<li><b>Read this document</b>. It should take < 15 minutes. Also
                    read <a href="http://hci.ucsd.edu/hollan/Pubs/Advice.pdf">
                    Jim's advice to grad students</a> and skim Scott Klemmer's
                    <a href="http://d.ucsd.edu/srk/lab/">lab policies and advice
                    to grad students</a>. That should take you 1-2 hours. Scott
                    is not a part of our group (though he co-directs the Design
                    Lab) and I don't agree with all of his policies, but he has
                    great advice on the tactics of doing good research (and his
                    thoughts inspired this document).
				<li>If you will be running an experiment with people, take the
                    <a href="https://www.citiprogram.org/">UCSD human subjects
                        course</a> and email me your completion certificate.
				<li><b>Set an intention</b> at the beginning of your rotation,
                    write it down, and share it with me. What will you
                    accomplish? Make a <b>conservative goal</b> that you're
                    reasonably certain you can accomplish, and a <b>stretch
                    goal</b> that might happen if things go really well. Having
                    a clear intention will enable you to focus your efforts,
                    work effectivey, and know when you're done. Decide what your
                    <b>final deliverable</b> will be (working code, a conference
                    publication, ...) and work backwards from there to put
                    together a <b>schedule</b> of what you'll accomplish this
                    quarter. Your plans will likely bounce around a bunch for
                    the first week-and-a-half but you should have a pretty clear
                    goal by the middle of your second week. <b>Update</b> your
                    conservative and stretch goals and schedule each week. A
                    good way to summarize all of this is to create an <b>
                    Individualized Development Plan (IDP)</b>. Here are some
                    <a href="../files/crystal_kwok_idp.pdf">good</a>
                    <a href="../files/rachel_chen_idp.pdf">examples</a>.
			</ol>

			<h2 class="mt-3">Meetings</h2>
			<p>Our group meets every <b>(TBD for Fall 2017)</b> in the Design
                Lab. Be on time as we often video conference with collaborators
                in France. These group meetings are a great place to share
                in-progress work, get high-level feedback, and plan for the next
                week. <b>Come prepared to talk for ~5 minutes</b> about what you
                have accomplished since the last meeting, what you plan to do
                this next week, and any road-blocks your are encountering. If
                you want feedback on something that people will need to spend
                time reading or reviewing, don't expect them to read or review
                during the meeting. Create a handout and email it to the group
                at least a day before the meeting.</p>

			<p>The student members of our group at UC San Diego have an
                additional <b>meeting every week</b> at (TBD for Fall 2017) in the
                Design Lab. These student meetings are a great venue for
                discussing the details of writing code, running studies, and
                analyzing data. Group meetings are for updates and strategizing.
                Student meetings are for tactics and getting work done.</p>

			<p>You should attend both meetings every week.  At the end of each
                meeting <b>clearly state what you will accomplish</b> by the
                next meeting.</p>

			<h2 class="mt-3">Files and Code</h2>
			<p>Keep all files in one of four places:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2uk3FIK7N1fOWZvbGRCWThQb2c">
                    Google Drive</a> (data, paper drafts)
				<li>Dropbox (rich documents like presentations)
				<li>The group iMac located in the Healthcare office upstairs
                    (Atkinson 6403). (video and audio recordings, private data)
                    Back up any data you store there on an external hard drive.
                    Ask me or one of the Design Lab admin for the code to get
                    into the room.
				<li><a href="https://github.com/activityhistory">GitHub</a> (code)
			</ol>

			<h2 class="mt-3">The Design Lab</h2>
			<p>Our research group is part of the larger
                <a href="http://dlab.ucsd.edu/">Design Lab</a>. Being a member
                of the our group also means you are a part of the Design Lab.
                You'll get a feel for the Design Lab culture over time, but
                here are some things you should know and do up front:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Ask me to add you to <b>design-students-l@mailman.ucsd.edu</b>
                    if you have not already been added to the Design Lab students
                    mailing list. This goes out to all the undergrads, MS, PhD,
                    and Post-docs in the lab and gets you on all the other lab
                    mailing lists.
				<li><b>Lab meeting</b> is every week at 2p on Wednesdays. Feel
                    free to come and hear about ongoing work in the lab from
                    other profs, post-docs, and students.
				<li>Every quarter we have a
                    <a href="http://designlab.ucsd.edu/#design-large">Design@Large</a>
                    seminar to hear from some of the leading researchers and
                    practicioners in HCI. For Fall 2017, we meet every
                    Wednesday from 4-5.15p, usually in CSE 1202
				<li>Lab events like Design@Large are on the <a href=https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=eng.ucsd.edu_t6e5g9i9ei7c5qf8rf4klvln9o%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles>Design Lab Google calendar</a>.
                    If you don't have access, email me.
				<li>Go to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B19kcnfzmiipcEwtend6ZmxuZDQ">Locals</a>
                    Google Drive folder for any lab related question. Again,
                    email me if you don't have access.
				<li>All the <b>whiteboards are fair game</b>. If you need to
                    erase something to make space,  take a picture of it first.
				<li>Help yourself to snacks and coffee in the kitchen. Just
                    clean up after yourself.
			</ol>

			<h2 class="mt-3">Reading</h2>
			<p>Great ideas rarely come out of the blue, so make time to regularly read relevant (and irrelevant) literature. If you want to do research in the future, learn the <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html">art of reading research papers</a>. Expect to <b>read about 25 papers to get up to speed on a topic</b> (e.g. automatic tutorial generation from screen recordings). If you find a useful paper or one that the group should know about, upload a pdf to the appropriate folder in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2uk3FIK7N1fOWZvbGRCWThQb2c">papers</a> folder of our Google Drive and add a 2-4 sentence summary of the paper to the related work summaries. Include links to the paper and any research videos. Research videos are a great way to quickly share cool research. If the paper is really good, email a link to the paper, video, or both to the group. </p>

			<h2 class="mt-3">Writing</h2>
			<p>Clear writing begets clear thinking. <b>Make a habit of writing about your work</b>, both what you have accomplished and what you plan to do. Start writing your papers well in advance of the deadline, and write each section as soon as reasonably possible. For example, you should write your methods section as you are running the study.</p>

			<h2 class="mt-3">Grad School Advice</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>When defining and evaluating your research, use the <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ddahlstr/misc/heilmeier.html">Heilmeier Catechism</a>
				<li>Read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-What-You-Came-For/dp/0374524777">Getting What you Came For</a> and <a href="http://pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm">PhD Grind</a>
				<li>Set boundaries on your work life so your personal and work life can thrive. You'll do much better work if you are well fed, well rested, and well loved so make time to eat right, exercise, sleep, and spend time with people who matter to you. For some great advice on doing deep work in grad school while limiting your time in the office see <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/">Cal Newport's blog</a>.

			<h2 class="mt-3">Projects</h2>
			<p>All of our research revoles around <b>helping people track,
                share, and make sense of the process of their work</b>. Ask me
                if you want to see the NSF grant proposal(s) that spawned this
                line of work. Under that umbrella, we have a number of research
                efforts:</p>
			<h3>Current</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Observing Jupyter Notebook Use - How is it that data
                    analysts track their work in Jupyter Notebooks, and how can
                    we build extensions to those notebooks that make it easier
                    for them to conduct reporducable, easily shared analyses?
			    <li>Enhancing Jupyter Notebook for Education - How might we
                    develop a data analysis curriculum and enhance Jupyter
                    Notebooks to help students learn to conduct high-quality
                    reproducatble analyses?
			    <li>Synopsis - Helping clinicians find the most relevant
                    information in a large collection of patient notes by
                    highlighting what other clinicians have paid attention to in
                    the past.
			</ul>

			<h3>Past</h3>
			<ul>
			    <li><a href="https://github.com/activityhistory/traces">Traces
                    </a> - Traces is our main activity recorder for tracking
                    clicks, keystrokes, apps used, window events, and taking
                    periodic screenshots on Mac computers.
				<li>Resumption Methods - Adam's <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2uk3FIK7N1fYTJJdklYZ1g3T00">
                    2nd year project</a> for Cog Sci qualification looked at
                    what people need to know to resume computer-mediated work
                    and how they use distributed cognition to reconstruct that
                    information.
				<li>Visualization - Once we've recorded work activity, we need
                    to visualize it in useful ways that leverage people's
                    cognitive strengths to reconstruct the details of past
                    activities. Early work on using small thumbnails to
                    represent past activity was <a href="https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0353/index.html">published</a>
                     at Cog Sci 2015.
			    <li>Privacy - Detailed tracking of work activity is very
                    invasive. Karen Boyd leads our efforts to understand the
                    privacy concerns people have with tracking work-related
                    activity. Here is a preliminary <a href = "https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2BzuzGGgHK3R2NmNE16WjhfUVk">writeup</a>
                     of this work.
