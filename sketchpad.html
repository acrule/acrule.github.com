    <p class="prompt">How can machinists manage digital and paper documents seamlessly?</p>

<br clear="all" />

<h3>Background</h3>

     <p> <em>Dates:</em> January - May 2010<br /> <em>Advisor:</em> <a href="http://www.ece.illinois.edu/directory/profile.asp?kim800">Katherine Kim</a>, <a href="http://ise.illinois.edu/research/faculty/goldberg/index.html">Prof. David Goldberg</a> </p>

    <p>My first exposure to User-Centered Design was in a course co-taught by the <a href="http://illinois.edu">University of Illinois</a> and <a href="http://olin.edu">Olin College</a>. The course intentionally followed the design process of <a href="http://www.ideo.com">IDEO</a>, an internationally acclaimed design group, through phases of exploration, ideation, co-design, and prototyping. In order to expose students to unstructured problems, the course open with a broad prompt: <em>Find a group of people who could benefit from good design</em>. My team chose study machinists in academia, those who produce machines and instruments for academic research.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

     <p>We used a number of methods in our research process:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Observation</strong> - Our team spent over 10 hours observing machinists as they worked in the shop environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Contextual Inquiry</strong> - Our team conducted unstructured interviews focused on the life-cycle of part orders in the machine shop.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Making</strong> - Our team created several conceptual models explaining the values and workflow of machinists.</li>
    <li><strong>Personas</strong> - Two personas were generated distinguishing machinists who focus on craftsmanship from those who focus on utilizing technology and teaching the next generation of machinists.</li>
    <li><strong>Ideation</strong> - Over 100 products ideas were generated in order to meet the needs of both personas.</li>
    <li><strong>Co-Design</strong> - Four product ideas were roughly prototyped and taken into machine shops for co-design with machinists in the shop context.</li>
    <li><strong>Prototyping</strong> - A final, revised product idea was both physically and digitally prototyped with foamcore and powerpoint.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Findings</h3>
    <p>A number of findings about machinists arose from our research</p>

<ul>
    <li>The shop environment is harsh and products made for machinists need to work amidst oil, metal shavings, high heat, and noise.</li>
    <li>The harsh environment of the shop means that computers are often in a separate area from the machines.</li> 
    <li>Machinists run back and forth between machine and computer, printing new documents each time a dimension is needed, or sometimes recreating the CAD models entirely from scratch.</li>
    <li>Older machinists want to be respected for the manual skills they have acquired</li>
    <li>Machinists need a quick way to annotate documents and find dimensions.</li>
    <li>Paper drawings and CAD files are currently separated in function and utility.</li>
    <li>Communication between researchers, shop foremen, and machinists centers around part drawings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prototype</h3>
     <p>Our team identified that machinists in academia have a need for improved document management. To address this need, our team designed the Sketchpad, a tablet for use in the machine shop environment. Our design included a physical form factor prototype, interface mockup, and requirements list. Our design bridges the gap between the manual and digital skills required in machine shops. It integrates CAD files and annotation support into a rigorous tablet able to withstand the harsh shop environment. The tablet links to both desktop computers and CNC machines, negating the use of floppy disks to transfer files. Most importantly, the Sketchpad allows experienced machinists with well-refined skills to more naturally make use of powerful CAD technology.</p>

     <p>Our project received top marks from our graders. Both the final product and design process caught the attention of university leaders. Our team was asked to present our design process and final product in front of several deans from the College of Engineering. This was the first User-Centered Design course offered by the College of Engineering at Illinois, and the sucess of our project prompted the College to continue offering the course which is now in its third year.</p>
