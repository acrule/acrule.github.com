<h2>Sketchpad</h2>

<p class="prompt">How can machinists manage digital and paper documents seamlessly?</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>My first exposure to User-Centered Design was in a course co-taught by the University of Illinois and Olin College. The course intentionally followed the design process of IDEO, an internationally acclaimed design group, through phases of exploration, ideation, co-design, and prototyping. Trying to teach engineers to deal with unstructured problems, the course open with a broad prompt: Find a group of people who could benefit from good design. My team chose study machinists in academia, those who produce the machines and instruments academic research is carried out with.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Observation - Our team spent over 10 hours observing machinists as they worked in the shop environment.</li>
    <li>Contextual Inquiry - Our team conducted unstructured interviews focused on the life-cycle of part order in the machine shop.</li>
    <li>Model Making - Our team created several models explaining the values and workflow of machinists.</li>
    <li>Personas - Two personas were generated distinguishing machinists focused on craftsmanship from those focused on utilizing technology and teaching the next generation of machinists.</li>
    <li>Ideation - Over 100 products meeting the needs of both personas were imagined.</li>
    <li>Co-Design - Four product ideas were roughly prototyped and taken into machine shops for co-design with machinists in the shop context.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Findings</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The shop environment is harsh and products made for machinists need to work amidst oil, metal shavings, high heat, and noise.</li>
    <li>The harsh environment of the shop means that computers have to be in a separate area from the machines.</li> 
    <li>Machinists run back and forth between machine and computer, printing new documents each time a dimension was needed, or sometimes recreating the CAD models entirely from scratch.</li>
    <li>Older machinists want to be respected for the manual skills they have acquired</li>
    <li>Machinists need a quick way to annotate documents and find dimensions.</li>
    <li>Paper drawings and CAD files are currently separated in function and utility</li>
    <li>Communication between researchers, shop foreman, and machinists centers around part drawings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prototype</h3>
<p>Our team designed the Sketchpad, a tablet for use in the machine shop environment. Our design included a physical form factor prototype, interface mockup, and requirements list. Our design bridges the gap between the manual and digital skills required in machine shops. It integrates CAD files and annotation support into a rigorous tablet able to withstand the harsh shop environment. The tablet links to both desktop computers and CNC machines, negating the use of floppy disks to transfer files. Most importantly, the Sketchpad allows old-timers with well-refined skills to more naturally make use of powerful CAD technology.</p>

<p>Our project received top marks from our graders and both product and process caught the attention of university leaders. Our team was asked to present our design process and final product in front several deans from the College of Engineering. This was the first User-Centered Design course offered by the College of Engineering at Illinois, and the sucess of our project prompted the College to continue offering the course which is now in its third year.</p>
