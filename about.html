<h3>Hello!</h3>

<img src="portrait.png" alt="Adam" align="left"></img>

<p>My name is Adam Rule and I am fascinated by how everything fits together. The world is a complex place full of people, resources, tools, and organizations. I like thinking about how it is all connected. 
</p>

<p> 
I am a systems thinker and I help people consider the affects of the tools they use and the organizations they build. Specifically, I design man-machine systems so that human dignity and well-being are preserved through their use. I believe technology can be a great servant or a cruel master, and that systems design has some role in ensuring it is the former. In my work I've revamped the scheduling policies of a public hospital to respect patients' time, improved the interaction design of an assistive robot to treat user's with dignity, and helped design a rapid fitting prosthetic arm for the developing world.
</p>

<p>
I specialize in human-computer interaction and user-centered design. Recently I have been reading up on systems thinking, considering how digital document design can afford relaxation, and studying how computer-mediated communication can facilitate better humanitarian crisis relief. I am currently a masters student in Human Centered Design & Engineering at the University of Washington. I enjoy green spaces, exploring cities, triathlon sports, critiquing music, and working with the local Church.
