<h3>What I do</h3>

<p> Hello! My name is Adam Rule and I help organizations harness complexity for humanity through a mix of design, engineering, and social science. We are surrounded by huge systems: public transit with hundreds of routes, libraries with thousands of volumes, an Internet with billions of pages. Yet, through things like time-tables, catalog numbers, and search engines we have tamed these numbers to answer some important questions like: </p>

<ol><li>Which bus will take me home? </li><li>Where can I find a copy of Shakespeare's Hamlet? </li><li>What is the nearest Italian restaurant? </li>
</ol>
<p>But, there is a difference between huge systems and complex systems. The difference is interaction. The more numerous and nuanced the interactions, the more complexity. Complex systems produce questions I love to wrestle with: </p>

<ol><li>How do you best care for a patient in a low budget hospital? </li> <li>How can a website predict what a person is looking for? </li> <li>How can a robot act respectfully towards the elderly? </li>
</ol>
<p> Organizing numbers is no longer enough to address these issues; matters of human desire, ability, and decision-making must come to bear. </p>

<p> I study complex problems through a mix of human factors, user-centered design, and industrial engineering. I have worked on projects ranging from the interaction design of an assistive robot to the form factor of a rapid-fitting prosthetic arm. This site details some of my work to date. </p>

<h3>What else I do</h3>

<p> I grew up in the Midwest learning to love four distinct seasons. With a passion for efficiency, I earned a BS in Industrial Engineering from the University of Illinois. I am continuing my studies in the Human Centered Design & Engineering Masters program at the University of Washington. </p>

<p> I enjoy green spaces, exploring cities, triathlon sports, critiquing music, and working with local manifestations of God's church. </p>
