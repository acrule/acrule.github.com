<p>Hello. My name is Adam Rule and I am fascinated by how everything fits together. The world is a complex place full of people, resources, tools, and organizations. I like thinking about how they are connected. 
</p>

<p> 
I am a human advocate in systems design. Specifically, I design man-machine interactions so that they preserve human dignity and well-being. I believe technology can be a great servant or a cruel master, and that thoughtful design has some role in preserving humanity over technology. In my work I've revamped the <a href="/hospital_scheduling.html">scheduling policies</a> of a public hospital to respect patients' time, improved the <a href="/herb.html">interaction design</a> of an assistive robot to treat people with respect, and helped design a rapid fitting prosthetic arm for the developing world.
</p>

<p>
I specialize in human-computer interaction and user-centered design. Recently I have been reading up on systems thinking, considering how digital document design can afford relaxation, and studying how computer-mediated communication can facilitate better humanitarian crisis relief. I am currently a Masters student in <a href="http://hcde.washington.edu">Human Centered Design & Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu">University of Washington</a>. I enjoy green spaces, exploring cities, triathlon sports, critiquing music, and working with the local Church.
