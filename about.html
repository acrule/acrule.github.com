<h3>Hello!</h3>

<p>My name is Adam Rule and I am fascinated how everything fits together. The world is a complex place, and thinking about how one thing influences another within the larger whole excites me. 
</p>

<p> 
I am a systems thinker and I help people consider how the tools they use affect their work, their play, and quite practically, their everything. Now, it is impossible to think about everything, which is why I like models. Models are the way we turn complex interactions into simple ones and go from considering everything to considering only those things that are significant. Everything in the universe pulls on the earth with gravity, only the sun and a few nearby planets do so significantly. So our models of planetary motion need only consider them; we can practically forget about the rest. 
</p>

<p>
I make models of the interactions between humans and machines. With these models I help companies design highly complex systems like computers and robots to be usable and useful by considering the significant parts of the interaction.
