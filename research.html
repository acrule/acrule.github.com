<h1>Current Research</h1>

<h2>Interruption Recovery</h2>
<p>
I'm working with <a href="http://hci.ucsd.edu/hollan/">Jim Hollan</a> and <a href="http://www.tabard.fr/">Aurelien Tabard</a> on software to help mitigate the impact of interruptions. Interruptions - by colleagues, computer alerts, and even self redirection - are a staple of knowledge work. They keep us up to date with relevant information and help us prioritize work. However, they can also make us forget what we were doing before being redirected. Visual stimuli have been shown to evoke rich episodic memory about past events, bringing to mind not only <em>what</em> was happening, but also <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> it was occuring. Well-designed information visualizations of past computer activity could help aleviate the cost of interruption.

<h2>ActiveNotes</h2>
<p>
Clinicians often have to document actions that were taken hours ago. For example, orders for medications, labs, or imaging are often placed during rounds, but documented in the note hours later. At this point the full rationale for the order may be hard to remember. I'm working with the <a href="http://www.vmrf.org/">Veterans' Medical Research Foundation</a> on a new interface for note creation that lets semi-structured text entery be used to document and place orders at the same time.

<h1>Past Projects</h1>

<h2>Robot Teams</h2>
<p>
I conducted research with <a href="http://goodgestreet.com/">Dr. Jodi Forlizzi</a> on the information needed to maintain situation awareness in multi-user, multi-robot systems. A <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2157705">paper</a> on this work was published at HRI 2012.
</p>

<h2>Home Exploring Robotic Butler</h2>
<p>
I conducted research with <a href="http://goodgestreet.com/">Dr. Jodi Forlizzi</a> on the interaction design of the <a href="http://personalrobotics.ri.cmu.edu/projects/herb.php">Home Exploring Robotic Butler</a>. I conducted an ethnographic case study of the relationship between a young man with quadriplegia  and his caregiver and used this study to inform the robot's design.

<h2>Cold-Chain Equipment Manager</h2>
<p>
I worked with <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/anderson">Dr. Richard Anderson</a> and <a href="http://www.path.org">PATH</a> to improve the usability of a cold-chain equipment management software used in Africa. I also developed several geospatial visualizations for the tool.
</p>

<h2>APT</h2>
<p>
I led a team of undergraduate design students, under the oversight of <a href="http://art.washington.edu/design/design-faculty/axel-roesler/">Dr. Axel Roesler</a>, on the design of a new paradigm for mobile apps. We created a <a href="http://vimeo.com/38522403">video prototype</a> of our idea: location-based apps.
</p>

<h2>Hospital Scheduling</h2>
<p>
I worked with a large public hospital, conducting a systems analysis of their patient scheduling. My team modeled the clinic environment and ran dozens of computer simulations, and recommended policies that reduced patient wait time and nurse overtime.
