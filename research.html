			I'm working with <a href="http://hci.ucsd.edu/hollan/">Jim Hollan</a> and <a href="http://www.tabard.fr/">Aurelien Tabard</a> on software to help mitigate the impact of interruptions on long-term creative work. Interruptions - by colleagues, computer alerts, and even self redirection - are a staple of knowledge work. They keep us up to date with relevant information and help us prioritize work. However, they can also make us forget what we were doing before being interrupted. Images have been shown to evoke rich episodic memory about past events, bringing to mind not only <em>what</em> was happening, but also <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> it was occuring. We are crafting visualizations of past computer activity that make it easier for knowledge workers to recall the mental context of their work. Keep track of our work on the <a href="http://activityhistory.github.io/">project website</a>.

			ActiveNotes is a <a href="http://www.vmrf.org/">Veterans Medical Research Foundation</a> project with the goal of developing more interactive clinical notes. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have greatly increased the usability and portability of health information by storing it as structured data. There are numerous benefits to having patient records in these computer-readable forms including being able to quickly search, exchange data between institutions, and provide real-time clinical decision support. However, today's EHRs rely on an aging paradigm of windows, tables, and drop-down menus to collect and display this information. This paradigm separates structured data from the valauble unstructured commentary of clinical notes. The ultimate goal of ActiveNotes is to develop interactive progress notes that unify entry, access, and retrieval of structured and unstructured health information. We are researching how clinicians currently interact with their notes, developing new ways of interacting with clinical notes, and testing prototype systems with clinicians.
