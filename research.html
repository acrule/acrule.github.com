			Clinicians often need to get up-to-speed on a patient's case by
            reviewing their medical record, but relevant information is
            fragmented across the record. This project is looking at ways to
            reorganize and summarize records so that clinicians can quickly
            understand to patient's current condition and past medical care.

			Interruptions - by colleagues, computer alerts, and even self
            interruption - are a staple of knowledge work. They keep us up to
            date with relevant information and help us prioritize. However,
            they can also make us forget what we were doing before being
            interrupted. Images have been shown to evoke rich episodic memory
            about past events, bringing to mind not only <em>what</em> was
            happening, but also <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> it was occuring.
            We are studying how people resume interrupted work and crafting
            visualizations of past computer activity that help them recall the
            mental context of their suspended activities. Keep track of the
            project at <a href="http://activityhistory.github.io/">

			Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have greatly increased the
            usability and portability of health information by storing it as
            structured data. However, today's EHRs rely on an aging paradigm of
            windows, tables, and drop-down menus to collect and display this
            information. This paradigm separates structured data from the
            valauble unstructured commentary of clinical notes. The  goal of
            ActiveNotes, a <a href="http://www.vmrf.org/">Veterans Medical
            Research Foundation</a> project, was to develop interactive progress
            notes that unify entry, access, and retrieval of structured and
            unstructured health information. My contributions to the project
            were the design and evaluation of an interface for free text entry
            of medication orders within a note that would pre-populate a set of
            clinical orders.
