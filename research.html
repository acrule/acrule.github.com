			I'm working with <a href="http://hci.ucsd.edu/hollan/">Jim Hollan</a> and <a href="http://www.tabard.fr/">Aurelien Tabard</a> on software to help mitigate the impact of interruptions. Interruptions - by colleagues, computer alerts, and even self redirection - are a staple of knowledge work. They keep us up to date with relevant information and help us prioritize work. However, they can also make us forget what we were doing before being redirected. Visual stimuli have been shown to evoke rich episodic memory about past events, bringing to mind not only <em>what</em> was happening, but also <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> it was occuring. Well-designed information visualizations of past computer activity could help aleviate the cost of interruption.

			Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have increased the utility and portability of health information by storing it in structured formats. However, EHRs separate this structured data from the rich, free-text descriptions of clinical notes, gathering and displaying it using pop-ups, tables, and forms that take significant time and attention to navigate. I'm working with the <a href="http://www.vmrf.org/">Veterans' Medical Research Foundation</a> on a new interface for note creation that lets semi-structured text entery be used to document and place orders at the same time. The ultimate objective of our research is to develop an interactive progress note that unifies entry, access, and retrieval of structured and unstructured health information.
