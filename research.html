<h1>Research Interests</h1>

<p>
Information technology is fantastically useful. The ability to store, process, and retrieve data has been so revolutionary that computer skills are required in nearly every line of work. But technology is not useful if it is not usable. Even the most advanced tool is worthless if it cannot be leveraged in the time of need. Usability is especially important in healthcare where people and technologies are a complex ecosystem and the consequences of error are severe. Traditional models of usability have viewed humans as relatively static, calmly clicking through pages and entering text. Healthcare, though, is dynamic. Clinicians are routinely interrupted and experience high levels of stress. I want to understand how information technology is used in this dynamic environment. 
</p><br/>
<p>
I am particularly interested in how doctors and nurses think. With paper notes, medical records, colleagues, and numerous other tools at their disposal, clinicians have a number of ways to solve any one problem. Cognition can move from inside the head to across the room. I want to understand how clinicians generate and manipulate representations of information across these various tools as they make decisions and solve problems. Is the process consistent, or does it change when interrupted or under stress? Do current health information technologies support this process, or hinder it by forcing a particular line of thought?
</p><br/>
<p>
User-centered design methods that focus on how clinicians work <em>in clinic</em> are an excellent way to improve our understanding of this area. Shadowing and contextual inquiry ground research in observation of actual workflows. Viewing these observations through the lens of distributed cognition provides a valuable method for diagnosing ways that technology is hindering cognitive work. With these methods, I believe more usable health information technology is within reach.

<h1>Past Research</h1>

<h2>Health</h2>

<h3>Cold-Chain Equipment Manager</h3> 

<p> 
I worked with <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/anderson">Dr. Richard Anderson</a> and <a href="http://www.path.org">PATH</a> to improve the usability of a cold-chain equipment management software used in Africa. I also developed several geospatial visualizations for the tool.
</p></br>

<h3>Baby Steps</h3> 
<p> 
I worked with <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/jkientz/">Dr. Julie Kientz</a> on the design of a mobile system for parents to track the developmental progress of their children. We tailored our design to serve the hispanic population in Washington state.
</p></br>

<h3>Hospital Scheduling</h3>
<p> 
I worked with a large public hospital, conducting a systems analysis of their patient scheduling. My team modeled the clinic environment and ran dozens of computer simulations, systematically searching for policies that reduced patient wait time and nurse overtime.
</p>

<h2>Robots</h2>

<h3>Robot Teams</h3>
<p>
I conducted research with <a href="http://goodgestreet.com/">Dr. Jodi Forlizzi</a> on the information needed to maintain situation awareness in multi-user, multi-robot systems. A <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2157705">paper</a> on this work was published at HRI 2012.
</p></br>

<h3>Robot Butler</h3>
<p> 
I conducted research with <a href="http://goodgestreet.com/">Dr. Jodi Forlizzi</a> on the interaction design of the <a href="http://personalrobotics.ri.cmu.edu/projects/herb.php">Home Exploring Robotic Butler</a>. I conducted an ethnographic case study of the relationship between a young man with quadriplegia  and his caregiver and used this study to inform the robot's design.
</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<h3>APT</h3>
<p> 
I worked with a team of undergraduate design students, under the oversight of <a href="http://art.washington.edu/design/design-faculty/axel-roesler/">Dr. Axel Roesler</a>, on the design of a new paradigm for mobile apps. We created a <a href="http://vimeo.com/38522403">video prototype</a> of a system of location-based apps.
</p></br>

<h3>Mamalode</h3>
<p> 
I worked with a team of HCI masters students on the redesign of a digital magazine for mothers. We conducted ethnographic research and developed an HTML/CSS prototype of the magazine for the iPad.
