<h1>Current Research</h1>

<h2>Interruption Recovery</h2>
<p>
Currently I'm working with <a href="http://hci.ucsd.edu/hollan/">Prof. Jim Hollan</a> on the design of software to help mitigate the effect of interruptions. Interruptions - by colleagues, computer alerts, and even self redirection - are a staple of knowledge work. They keep us up to date with relevant information and help us prioritize work. However, they can also make us forget what we were doing before being redirected. Visual stimuli has been shown to evoke rich episodic memory about past events, bringing to mind not only <em>what</em> was happening, but also <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> it was occuring. We believe that well-design information visualizations of past computer activity can help aleviate the cost of interruption.

<h1>Past Projects</h1>

<h2>Robot Teams</h2>
<p>
I conducted research with <a href="http://goodgestreet.com/">Dr. Jodi Forlizzi</a> on the information needed to maintain situation awareness in multi-user, multi-robot systems. A <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2157705">paper</a> on this work was published at HRI 2012.
</p>

<h2>Home Exploring Robotic Butler</h2>
<p> 
I conducted research with <a href="http://goodgestreet.com/">Dr. Jodi Forlizzi</a> on the interaction design of the <a href="http://personalrobotics.ri.cmu.edu/projects/herb.php">Home Exploring Robotic Butler</a>. I conducted an ethnographic case study of the relationship between a young man with quadriplegia  and his caregiver and used this study to inform the robot's design.
</p>

<h2>Cold-Chain Equipment Manager</h2> 
<p> 
I worked with <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/anderson">Dr. Richard Anderson</a> and <a href="http://www.path.org">PATH</a> to improve the usability of a cold-chain equipment management software used in Africa. I also developed several geospatial visualizations for the tool.
</p>

<h2>APT</h2>
<p> 
I led a team of undergraduate design students, under the oversight of <a href="http://art.washington.edu/design/design-faculty/axel-roesler/">Dr. Axel Roesler</a>, on the design of a new paradigm for mobile apps. We created a <a href="http://vimeo.com/38522403">video prototype</a> of our idea: location-based apps.
</p>

<h2>Hospital Scheduling</h2>
<p> 
I worked with a large public hospital, conducting a systems analysis of their patient scheduling. My team modeled the clinic environment and ran dozens of computer simulations, and recommended policies that reduced patient wait time and nurse overtime.
