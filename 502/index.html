			<p>Hello. My name is Adam Rule and I design information systems that fit humans: their needs, wants, and abilities. Making human-centered systems requires a vast knowledge not only of technology, but also of humans and their interaction with machines. This corpus of knowledge is too vast for me to explore on my own, so it is critical that I learn from other practitioners in the field, that I know how to digest and apply their work.</p><p>This portfolio demonstrates my ability to understand, critique, and apply empirical research. All of its pieces come from a course in research criticism I completed while a Masters student in <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/">Human Centered Design and Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://washington.edu">University of Washington</a>. Through this course I gained the vocabulary and rigor to evaluate research findings and claims.</p><p>On the one hand, I have gained the ability to read broadly, to look across multiple publications of a journal or multiple instances of a research method and articulate trends and common practices. I have also learned to read deeply, inspecting a single publication across a broad range of measures. Again, I have looked broadly across the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to learn from technologists, sociologists, educators, and others. More specifically I have delved deeply into the smaller sub-field of Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICTD) to grow my expertise in a focused area.</p><p>Aside from being able to read broadly and deeply, I have a vocabulary with which to critique research. Rigor, relevance, generalizability, and various types of validity as well as methods of logical argument are all at my disposal in critiquing the quality of empirical research. Also available to me are methods of critique, specific language to look for, and an understanding of the structure of papers.</p><p>Lastly, I have gained an understanding of current trends in HCI. I have read on both sides of debates over quantitative versus qualitative methods, positivism versus interpretivism, and context versus implications for practice.</p><p>This wide host of knowledge and tools would benefit any organization looking to make wise use of HCI research.</p>
