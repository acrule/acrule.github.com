          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>The Radiation Oncology department at UC San Diego was unhappy with how they reviewed patient treatment plans. The department's accreditation board required that clinicians use some form of "chart rounds" to to check and suggest improvements to one another's treatment plans. However, the department's weekly chart round meetings rarely led to treatment changes and felt like a waste of time to some clinicians.

          <p><em><span style="background-color:#d7e1ee;">I worked with clinicians in Radiation Oncology to identify goals of their chart rounds meetings, highlight problems, and brainstorm solutions.</span></em></p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:40px">Research Plan</h3>
          With my limited knowledge of Radiation Oncology, I could not propose a solution that would be adopted but would need to guide the clinicians to formulating one on their own. I attended a half-dozen chart rounds meetings in the department to get a sense for the workflow and technologies involved, and then invited three clinicians to a series of half-day design workshops.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:40px">Design Workshops</h3>
          <p><span style="background-color:#d7e1ee;">The hardest part of the workshops was scheduling. Thankfully, the department chair made this project a priority and several clinicians in the department had protected time for research.</span></p>

          <p>In the first of two workshops I guided the clinicians through making distinct observations about specific prior chart rounds meetings, clustering their observations into insights through affinity diagramming, and then abstracting key goals and problems with chart rounds. In a second workshop I walked the clinicians through brainstorming diverse solutions to key problems identified in the prior workshop, and paper prototyping a promising solution. We finished the workshop by discussing how to prototype and test higher-fidelity versions of the proposed system before implementing it in full detail.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:8px;"><span style="color: #999"><em>Clinicians formed affinity diagrams during the design workshop to identify goals and problems with chart rounds.</em></span></p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:40px">Results</h3>
          At the end of the second workshop, the clinicians had designed a set of changes to their chart rounds that involved both modifying the meeting's format and goals as well as using a web-based review system for rapid and targeted review of treatment plans that would meet both the clinicians' goals and the goals of their accreditor.
