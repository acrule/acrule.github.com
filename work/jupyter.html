          <h3>Jupyter Notebooks</h3>
          <p>Multi-Methods Study</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-9">

          <p><em>Note: I ran this study as part of my PhD research and previously presented results in <a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/we-analyzed-1-million-jupyter-notebooks-now-you-can-too-guest-post-8116a964b536">a post on Project Jupyter's official blog</a> and <a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/171/1m-jupyter-notebooks-analyzed">a guest appearance</a> on the TalkPython podcast.</em></p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:40px">Problem</h3>
          <p>Project Jupyter had been building data analysis tools for years and were <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/">receiving a lot of a attention</a> for their notebook product which let analysts mix code, visualizations, and text in interactive reports. Project Jupyter believed the main benefit of using their notebooks was begin able to craft rich <a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/project-jupyter-computational-narratives-as-the-engine-of-collaborative-data-science-2b5fb94c3c58">computational narratives</a> that clearly explaned a complex analysis to others, but they had little data on how analysts were actually using their product.</p>

          <p><em><span style="background-color:#d7e1ee;">In this study, I tested the assumption that analysts were using Jupyter Notebooks to write and share rich narrative descriptions of their analyses.</span></em></p>

          <p style="margin-top:8px;"><span style="color: #999"><em>An example of a Jupyter Notebook mixing data analysis code, information visualizations, and text to create a compuatational narrative. </em></span></p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:40px">Research Plan</h3>
          <p>Since, there are millions of people using Jupyter Notebooks for different purposes, <span style="background-color:#d7e1ee;">I needed to reduce scope to get a meaningful result in the project's 2-month timeline.</span> I focused on academic researchers because 1) academic users were assumed to be the most likely to format their notebooks as narratives for others to read and 2) I could easily recruit them.</p>

          <p>“Computational narrative” is a fuzzy concept so I instead decided to measure 1) the amount of descriptive text in a notebook, 2) how descriptive that text was, and 3) if notebooks were used to share analyses with others or kept private. Since these are both qualitative and quantitative measures, <span style="background-color:#d7e1ee;">I used multiple methods to triangulate my results. <em>These included interviewing 15 academic data analysts, analyzing 1 million notebooks shared publicly online, and hand-coding 200 notebooks published alongside academic papers</span></em></p>

          <img src="../images/jupyter_steps.png" class="img-fluid">
          <p style="margin-top:8px;"><span style="color: #999"><em>I conducted three parallel studies to examing how data analysts used Jupyter Notebooks. </em></span></p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:40px">Interviews</h3>
          <p>I recruited participants by attending lab meetings and using snowball sampling to recruit multiple participants from six different labs. <span style="background-color:#d7e1ee;">To ground the interviews in real-world experience, I had each participant walk me through a Jupyter Notebook they were currently using and I asked follow-up questions about how they organized and shared their notebooks.</span> Their responses highlighted that while notebooks were great for iteratively developing analysis scripts, they were difficult to organize as narratives and rarely shared.</p>

          <p style="margin-top:8px;"><span style="color: #999"><em>Participants talked about how their exploratory data analyses resulted in messy and poorly annotated notebooks. </em></span></p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:40px">Analyzing 1 Million Notebooks and Hand-Coding 200 Notebooks</h3>
          <p>To make sure it wasn't just academic analysts who found it difficult to write clear narratives in Jupyter Notebooks, I found a website where analysts from various backgrounds posted their notebooks online. This website had over 1 million Jupyter Notebooks on it, but I knew analyzing the text in each of them would be a big task. I started by analyzing a small sample, just 1000 notebooks, before automating my analysis to run on the entire dataset while I worked on other tasks.</p>

          <p>One of those tasks was hand-coding a smaller set of notebooks to measure not only how much text the typical notebook had, but how descriptive that text was. I hired a research assistant to help me find notebooks that had been published alongside academic papers (assuming these would likely have text in them to support other scientists replicating the analysis). We iteratively read and hand-coded 200 notebooks, finding that most used text to describe high-level steps rather than describe analyses in more detail.</p>


          <h3 style="margin-top:40px">Results</h3>
          <p>This project had numerous deliverables for different stakeholders. <span style="background-color:#d7e1ee;"> I presented my results in-person to the core developers and founders of Project Jupyter, who discussed it for more than an hour at a recent off-site as they planned their project roadmap for the next year.</span></p>

          <p>Being academic research, I was also able to report my findings beyond the product team. Project Jupyter invited me to summarize my results in a post on their official blog. I was also invited to present my findings on a developer focused podcast. And I cleaned and posted the entire 500Gb dataset of over 1 million notebooks online where it has already been used by other researchers.</p>
