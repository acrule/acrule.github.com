          <h3>Jupyter Notebooks</h3>
          <p>Multi-Methods Study</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-9">

          <p><em>Note: I conducted this study as part of my PhD research and have previously presented the results in <a href="http://adamrule.com/files/papers/chi_2018_computational_notebooks_final_web.pdf">an award-winning academic paper</a>, <a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/we-analyzed-1-million-jupyter-notebooks-now-you-can-too-guest-post-8116a964b536">a post on Project Jupyter's official blog</a>, and <a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/171/1m-jupyter-notebooks-analyzed">a guest appearance</a> on the TalkPython podcast.</em></p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:40px">Problem</h3>
          <p>Project Jupyter had been building tools to support data analysts for years and were <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/">receiving a lot of a attention</a> for their notebook product that let analysts mix data analysis code and data visualizations with richly formatted text to create interactive reports. Project Jupyter believed the main benefit of using their notebook software was that it enabled data analysts to craft rich <a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/project-jupyter-computational-narratives-as-the-engine-of-collaborative-data-science-2b5fb94c3c58">computational narratives</a> to share with others, but they had little data on how analysts were actually using their software.</p>

          <p><em><span style="background-color:#d7e1ee;">In this study I sought to test the assumption that notebooks made it easy to craft rich computational narratives.</span></em></p>

          <p style="margin-top:8px;"><span style="color: #999"><em>An example of a Jupyter Notebook mixing data analysis code, information visualizations, and text to create a compuatational narrative. </em></span></p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:40px">Research Plan</h3>
          <p><span style="background-color:#d7e1ee;">“Computational narrative” is a fuzzy concept so I first decided to operationalize it</span> as 1) the amount of descriptive text in a notebook, 2) whether that text was used to describe analyses in detail or just list steps, and 3) if notebooks were being used to actively share data and analyses with others or were just for personal use.</p>

          <p>Next, there were millions of people using Jupyter Notebooks for different purposes, so I needed to reduce my scope scope if I was to get a meaningful result in the project's 2 month timeline. I decided to focus on academic researchers because 1) academic users were assumed to be lead users (if anyone was writing rich narratives in their notebooks, they would be) and 2) I could easily recruit them.</p>

          <p>Finally, I decided to use multiple methods to triangulate my results. I could get rich descriptions of how people used notebooks by interviewing analysts, but I wouldn’t be able to say much about how representative those users were without some quantitative data to back up my claims.<p>

          <p><em><span style="background-color:#d7e1ee;">I conducted three parallel studies: interviewing 15 academic data analysts, analyzing 1 million notebooks shared publicly online, and hand-coding 200 notebooks published alongside academic papers</span></em></p>

          <p style="margin-top:8px;"><span style="color: #999"><em>I conducted three parallel studies to examing how data analysts used Jupyter Notebooks. </em></span></p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:40px">Interviews</h3>
          <p>I recruited participants by attending lab meetings and using snowball sampling to recruit multiple participants from six different labs. <span style="background-color:#d7e1ee;">To ground the interviews in real-world experience, I had each participant walk me through a Jupyter Notebook they were using currently and asked follow-up questions about how they organized and shared their notebooks.</span> Their responses highlighted that while notebooks were great for iteratively developing data analysis scripts, they were note comfortable sharing them with others without tediously cleaning them first.</p>

          <img src="../images/sketch.JPG" class="img-fluid">
          <p style="margin-top:8px;"><span style="color: #999"><em>Participants talked about how their exploratory data analyses resulted in messy and poorly annotated notebooks. </em></span></p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:40px">Analyzing 1 Million Notebooks</h3>
          <p>To make sure that it wasn't just my interviewees from academic labs who found it difficult to write clearly annotated Jupyter Notebooks, I found a website where analysts often posted their notebooks publicly. This website had over 1 million Jupyter Notebooks on it and while it had tools for downloading them, I knew this would be a big task. I started by running my entire analysis on just a small sample, just 1000 notebooks, before I scaled it up to the entire dataset. In the end, I was able to show that a large portion of notebook on this site had no text in them at all.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top:40px">Hand-Coding 200 Notebooks</h3>
          <p>Finally, I wanted to say something more specific about how analysts were using text in their Jupyter Notebooks. Yes, many didn't have any text in them, but of those that did, what was that text there for? I hired a research assistant to help me find notebooks that had been published alongside academic papers (assuming these would likely have text in them to support other's replicating the analysis). We iteratively read and hand-coded 200 such notebooks, finding that most used text to describe high-level steps rather than describe analyses in more detail.</p>


          <h3 style="margin-top:40px">Results</h3>
          <p>This project had a lot of deliverables for different stakeholders. <span style="background-color:#d7e1ee;">First, I presented my results in-person to core developers and one of the founders of Project Jupyter and was later told by one of the team that they discussed my research for an hour at a recent organizational off-site while planning their project roadmap for the next year.</span></p>

          <p>Being academic research, I was also able to report my findings beyond the product team. Project Jupyter invited me to summarize my results in a post on their official blog. A paper I wrote describing my work for an academic audience earned a best paper honorable mention from the top conference in Human-Computer Interaction. I was invited to present my findings on a developer focused podcast. And I released my entire 500Gb dataset online which has already been used for other studies. I was even contacted by a team at Mozilla developing a similar product and have spoken with them twice about the implications of my work for their design.</p>
